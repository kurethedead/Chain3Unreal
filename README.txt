To use, look for GetChain3DataSubsystem in blueprint search to access the subsystem. You can then call its functions to modify/query the persistent state (see the Call Function subcategory in blueprints). Note that by default the state is loaded on game start and saved on game end. To override this behaviour, extend the Chain3DataSubsystem class with a blueprint, and disable the member variable booleans that trigger these behaviours.
