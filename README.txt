This is a plugin to interface with the CHAIN 3 door / shared data systems. Add this to your project's Plugins/ folder (see how to install an Unreal plugin for more details).

To use, look for GetChain3DataSubsystem in blueprint search to access the subsystem. You can then call its functions (located in the "Chain Data" category) to modify/query the persistent state.
